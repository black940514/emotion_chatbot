I delight in witnessing the sunset in the evening, a tradition I maintained from my days as a beach lifeguard,
and I revel in observing the stars at midnight, a fascination sparked by my amateur astronomer father.
I relish the sensation of rain on my skin, a reminder of summer monsoons,
and I treasure the fragrance of fresh flowers in a meadow, reminiscent of the wildflower fields near my family home.
I take pleasure in watching birds soar across the sky,
often spending hours with my binoculars and birdwatching journal,
and I engage in deep thinking when insomnia strikes in the middle of the night,
a habit from my college days studying philosophy.
